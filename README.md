I wan t to make a site where i can store my dnd maps for my players, seperate them by campaign and simply show my players a link that they need to click on.
Possibly add a feature that allows me to fog the map and reveil it over time, and a feature that allows me to put basic annotation on parts of the map.

 framework(s) / 
             I have no Frameworks that i am looking at as i am still solidifying what i want to do
 API(s) / 
             I have no APIs that i am looking at as i am still solidifying what i want to do
 data source(s) / 
             The Data sources will be maps that i have made myself and have uploaded
 backend(s)
            I have no external backends that i am looking at as i am still solidifying what i want to do, However i will probably do most of the back end development myself
